I reasoned to think about mini ecosystems of which cities can connect. Then starting a one hospital add as many possible if they can take the place of two highways. |
| September 11 | 12:45-1:145  | I was intially thinking that you would start with all the highways then subtract two highways per ecosystem. I now understand that it would be easier to start with zero highways and all hospitals, thinking of each hospital as it's own ecosystem. My next step would involve learning how to merge the cities to delete hospitals repeatly until having the optimized ecosystem layout. |
