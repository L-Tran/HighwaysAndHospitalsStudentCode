| September 11 | 10am-10:25pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I thought about how to solve the problem in a general sense. I reasoned to think about mini ecosystems of which cities can connect. Then starting a one hospital add as many possible if they can take the place of two highways. |
| September 11 | 12:45-1:145  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I was initially thinking that you would start with all the highways then subtract two highways per ecosystem. I now understand that it would be easier to start with zero highways and all hospitals, thinking of each hospital as it's own ecosystem. My next step would involve learning how to merge the cities to delete hospitals repeatedly until having the optimized ecosystem layout. |
| September 14 | 7:30-8:40pm  | I created a boolean array that stores whether each city has a hospital or not, this way I can determine whether I can merge cities. However, though I can tell if each city has a hospital but I still don't know how to figure out of each ecosystem has a hospital. I coded how to "merge" cities cities by deleting a hospital and adding a highway but again, there is the same problem with know if a city connected to it has a hospital or not so maybe I need to start adding cities with hospitals to groups and then check if the groups have hospitals. I code some during this time but most of it was thinking how to code what I have and what I have to do next. |
| September 16 | 1:55-2:31pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I started to code union find for highways and hospitals. I understand how to code every aspect of union find except for the actual algorithm. I'm struggling on how to find the "highest" root of each city, where right now I can only find the city that directly connects to the city. I need to fix this issue by making sure each city's root refers to the highest root instead of the one right next to it. |

At first, I had no idea why this was the case, but as I debugged, I deducted that it was probably from the while loop that does the actual finding of the roots. Next, I will implement union find so that it can correctly find the topmost root of each component . |
| September 21 |    2-4:15    |                                                      After lots of trial and failure I finally finished union find correctly with path compression and weight balancing. I made a helper function for union-find to have better abstraction. I spent so long on this because I kept getting confused about the indexes, cities, roots, and their copies. Next time it could be helpful to keep better track of them so I don't use the wrong variables for the right usages. It was also hard to understand how the union find actually works, especially the path compression. At first I just had to trust the process but as I understood it better it became easier to code. |
