I reasoned to think about mini ecosystems of which cities can connect. Then starting a one hospital add as many possible if they can take the place of two highways. |

I now understand that it would be easier to start with zero highways and all hospitals, thinking of each hospital as it's own ecosystem. My next step would involve learning how to merge the cities to delete hospitals repeatedly until having the optimized ecosystem layout. |
| September 14 | 7:30-8:40pm  | I created a boolean array that stores whether each city has a hospital or not, this way I can determine whether I can merge cities. However, though I can tell if each city has a hospital but I still don't know how to figure out of each ecosystem has a hospital. I coded how to "merge" cities cities by deleting a hospital and adding a highway but again, there is the same problem with know if a city connected to it has a hospital or not so maybe I need to start adding cities with hospitals to groups and then check if the groups have hospitals. I code some during this time but most of it was thinking how to code what I have and what I have to do next. |

I understand how to code every aspect of union find except for the actual algorithm. I'm struggling on how to find the "highest" root of each city, where right now I can only find the city that directly connects to the city. I need to fix this issue by making sure each city's root refers to the highest root instead of the one right next to it. |
